What it does:

"Arknights Recruit Helper" assists in recruiting in Arknights by automatically recognizing
tags and creating a list of which tag combinations can recruit which operators.
The list is sorted in such a way that the rarest results appear at the top.


How it works:

"Arknights Recruit Helper" takes a screenshot of the emulator running Arknights and compares
it with images of all possible tags to determine which ones are most likely. To make this work,
the name of the emulator window must be known, and the position for the screenshots must be properly set.
Both can be adjusted under Options.


About me:

"Arknights Recruit Helper" is the first project I am publishing,
and I learned programming almost exclusively through YouTube or similar platforms. Accordingly,
I am inexperienced, and I'm sure my code reflects that.
So I'm grateful for any feedback, even if it's harsh, as long as it helps me improve.


Note for Compiling:

If you plan on compiling "Arknights Recruit Helper" yourself, please note that the res folder must be located in the same directory as the executable.
